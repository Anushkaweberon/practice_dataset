            <p>
              A new report has just been released, which identifies the 6 most common and 
              costly mistakes homebuyers make before buying a home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mortgage 
              regulations have changed significantly over the last few years, making your 
              options wider than ever. Subtle changes in how you approach mortgage 
              shopping, and even minor differences in how you structure your mortgage, 
              can save or cost you thousands of dollars and years of expense.
            </p> 
            <p>
              Whether you are about to buy your first home or are planning to make a 
              move to your next home, you must inform yourself about the 
              factors involved before you buy.
            </p>
            <p>

              Insiders have prepared a FREE special report entitled "6 Things You Must Know 
              Before You Buy."
            </p>
            <p>
              Having the correct information beforehand can  
              make a significant difference in this critical negotiation.

            How to Avoid Costly<br>Housing Mistakes Before<br>and After a Divorce
          sec2LeftText: |
            <p>
              Divorce is rarely easy and often means a lot of difficult
              decisions. One of the most critical decisions is
              what to do about the house.
            </p>
            <p>
              Amid the heavy emotional and financial
              turmoil, what you need most is some non-emotional,
              straightforward, specific information and answers. Once
              you know how a divorce affects your home, your mortgage
              and taxes, critical decisions are more accessible. Neutral, 
              third-party information can help you make logical, rather 
              emotional, decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first decision is whether you want to
              continue living in the house. Will the familiar surroundings
              bring comfort, emotional security, or unpleasant
              memories? Do you want to minimize change by staying
              where you are or selling your home and moving to a new
              place that offers a fresh start? Only you can answer those
              questions, but there will certainly be some financial
              repercussions to your decision process. What can you
              afford? Can you manage the old house on your new budget?
              Is refinancing possible? Or is it better to sell and buy? How
              much home can you buy on your new budget?
            </p>
            <p>
              To help you know what questions you should ask
              and how to arrive at the correct answer for your specific
              situation, a FREE special report has been prepared by
              industry experts entitled “Divorce: What You Need to
              Know About Your House, Your Mortgage and Taxes.”
