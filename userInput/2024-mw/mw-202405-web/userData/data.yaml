            10 Ways to Save Money When<br>
            Buying a New <span data-slot="dwc" data-param-slot-name="mw_city"></span> Home
          leftSec1Text: |
            <p>
              Although most
              homes for sale are resale, one of
              four homebuyers purchases a new home.
              Which is better: existing or new? The correct
              answer, of course, is up to you. Both resales
              and new homes offer advantages.
              Existing homes are less expensive on
              average, and are generally closer to, and
              enjoy the warmth and surroundings of,
              established neighborhoods, often with
              mature landscaping.
            </p>
            <p>
              New homes, on the other hand,
              offer innovative use of space, more incredible energy
              efficiency and choices of options
              and upgrades. Everything is new and
              modern.
            </p> 
            <p>
              Most people consider both new
              and existing homes before they decide to
              purchase. A new, special insider report
              entitled “New Homes - 10 Tips to Save
              You Time and Money” has just been
              released, which identifies 10 invaluable
              tips to save you time and money when
              purchasing a brand-new home. Also
              revealed are little-known buyer advantages
              that most builders may not tell you.

            11 Critical Home Inspection<br>
            Traps to be Aware of Weeks<br>
            Before Listing Your<br>
            <span data-slot="dwc" data-param-slot-name="mw_city"></span> Home for Sale
          sec2LeftText: |
            <p>
              According to industry experts
              there are over 33 physical problems that will come
              under scrutiny during a home inspection when your
              home is for sale. A new report has been prepared which
              identifies the eleven most common of these problems,
              and what you should know about them before you list
              your home for sale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you own an old home or a brand new
              one, there are several things that can fall short
              of requirements during a home inspection. If not
              identified and dealt with, any of these 11 items could
              cost you dearly in terms of repair. That’s why it’s critical
              that you read this report before you list your home. If
              you wait until the building inspector flags these issues
              for you, you will almost certainly experience costly
              delays in the close of your home sale or, worse, turn
              prospective buyers away altogether. In most cases,
              you can make a reasonable pre-inspection yourself if
              you know what you’re looking for and know what
              you’re looking for can help you prevent little problems
              from growing into costly and unmanageable ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              To help home sellers deal with this issue before
              their homes are listed, a free report entitled “11 Things
              You Need to Know to Pass Your Home Inspection” has
              been compiled, which explains the issues involved.
