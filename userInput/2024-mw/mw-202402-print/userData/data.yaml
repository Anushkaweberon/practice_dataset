          p1bs1rContent: |
            <p>
              If you’re like most homebuyers, you have two primary considerations in mind when you start looking for a home. 
              First, you want to find the home that perfectly meets your needs and desires and secondly,
               purchase this home for the lowest possible price.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you analyze those successful home buyers who have been able to purchase the home 
              they want for thousands of dollars below a seller’s asking price, some common denominators
               emerge. While your agent's negotiating skills are important, three additional key factors 
               must come into play long before you ever submit an offer.
            </p> 
            <p>
              Remember, buying a home is a significant milestone, and whether it’s your first, second or 
              tenth, there are many small but important details, not to mention stress and excitement,
               to deal with during the process. The last thing you need is unbudgeted financial obligations 
               in the hours before you take possession of your new home.
            </p>
            <p>
              To help homebuyers understand what these extra costs are and in what situations they may 
              apply, a free industry report has been prepared called “13 Extra Costs to Be Aware of Before 
              Buying a Home.”
            </p>
