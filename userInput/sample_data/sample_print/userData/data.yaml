          <div class="quotes">
          Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, 
          worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience 
          of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude</div>
          <div class="quotes">
          Everything has its wonders, even darkness and silence, and 
          I learn, whatever state I may be in, therein to be content.
          </div>
          <div class="quotes">
          You will never be happy if you continue to search for what 
          happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking 
          for the meaning of life.
          </div>
