          para1: Spring is Springing! Yay! I just came inside from shooting a video outside, and WOW! It’s nice out! Yes, I realize that when you read this, it could be cold and rainy, but those cold days are just about over. Everyone loves Spring, primarily because it means… summer is near!
          para2: For many across this great country, though, it’s still COLD, grey, and snowy! One thing is for sure, this winter season is ending. It does every year without fail.
          para3: Just like the weather seasons come and go, so do the seasons of life. I just turned 55, my oldest is growing her own Real Estate business, and my youngest is helping us help you grow yours. Are you with me when I say these seasons seem to come and go faster and faster, as well as time? My wife reminded me that we shared 33 of my birthdays together last night. Some of life’s seasons will be HOT, and others will be COLD, some high and some low. The lows we want to move by quickly, the highs we want to stay in forever. But it’s the low points, those tough times, that I have learned the most from. All of the experiences through these seasons made me who I am. (see inside for details)

          rightPara1: In fact, if it’s OK with you, let me focus just a bit on the REFERRAL request.
          rightPara2: Please know that my team and I are eager to help anyone you know who wants to make a move, so much that we are willing to make an offer that they will LOVE.
          rightPara3: For March, for anyone considering making a move that you refer to me, we will guarantee them in writing their home will sell, or we’ll buy it at a price acceptable to them.
          rightPara4: We just need to agree on the price and possession date with the seller.
          rightPara5: This is where you can help!
          rightPara6: If you or anyone you know is considering moving, we would like to offer them a FREE No Obligation Market Analysis that will give them an accurate idea of what they can expect to sell their home for.
          rightPara7: Just like we are thankful for you and your business, I am confident your referrals will thank you for steering them in the right direction to getting their home sold!!!
