          leftSec1Text: |
            <p>
              If you’re like most homebuyers, you have two primary considerations in mind when you start looking for a home. 
              First, you want to find the home that perfectly meets your needs and desires and secondly,
               purchase this home for the lowest possible price.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you analyze those successful home buyers who have been able to purchase the home 
              they want for thousands of dollars below a seller’s asking price, some common denominators
               emerge. While your agent's negotiating skills are important, three additional key factors 
               must come into play long before you ever submit an offer.
            </p> 
            <p>
              Remember, buying a home is a significant milestone, and whether it’s your first, second or 
              tenth, there are many small but important details, not to mention stress and excitement,
               to deal with during the process. The last thing you need is unbudgeted financial obligations 
               in the hours before you take possession of your new home.
            </p>
            <p>
              To help homebuyers understand what these extra costs are and in what situations they may 
              apply, a free industry report has been prepared called “13 Extra Costs to Be Aware of Before 
              Buying a Home.”
            </p>

            <p>A new report has just been released, which reveals 7 costly mistakes that most homeowners make when selling their home, and a 9 Step System that can help you sell your home fast and for the most money.</p>
            <p>This industry report shows clearly how the traditional ways of selling homes have become increasingly less and less effective in today’s market. The fact of the matter is that three-quarters of home sellers don’t get what they want for their homes and become disillusioned and - worse - financially disadvantaged when they put their homes on the market.</p>
            <p>As this report uncovers, most homes ellers make 7 deadly mistakes that cost them thousands of dollars. The good news is that every one of these mistakes is entirely preventable. In answer to this issue, industry insiders have prepared a free special report entitled “The 9-Step System to Get Your Home Sold Fast and For Top Dollar”.</p>
