          para1: Spring is Springing! Yay! I just came inside from shooting a video outside, and WOW! It’s nice out! Yes, I realize that when you read this, it could be cold and rainy, but those cold days are just about over. Everyone loves Spring, primarily because it means… summer is near!
          para2: For many across this great country, though, it’s still COLD, grey, and snowy! One thing is for sure, this winter season is ending. It does every year without fail.
          para3: Just like the weather seasons come and go, so do the seasons of life. I just turned 55, my oldest is growing her own Real Estate business, and my youngest is helping us help you grow yours. Are you with me when I say these seasons seem to come and go faster and faster, as well as time? My wife reminded me that we shared 33 of my birthdays together last night. Some of life’s seasons will be HOT, and others will be COLD, some high and some low. The lows we want to move by quickly, the highs we want to stay in forever. But it’s the low points, those tough times, that I have learned the most from. All of the experiences through these seasons made me who I am. (see inside for details)

        page4BottomHeaderText: Why support underprivileged kids
        page4BottomHeaderImage: img/logo.png
      page4BottomBody: |
        I came to the United States 35 years ago, as an engineering student. As I left India and my loving middle class family. I carried with me the value of dreaming BIG and persevering that dream with determination and deep dedication. I am at a very comfortable place today. However, the one thing that still haunts me is the awareness that 45% of the children around the world die of malnutrition (source: worldhunger.org). Even though we have enough food supply to feed 7.7 billion people, we let these children die every hour. Is it not deeply disconcerting to say the least?<br><br>
        The idea of making a difference started with my visit to our housemaids hut, devoid of all the basic necessities, in addition to the lack of a bathroom. The faces of her two malnourished children held the blueprint to their everyday life compelling me to think about sharing. It seems magical that these kids are now grown up healthy, educated, and have settled comfortably carrying forward what they received in generosity.<br><br>
        Encouraged by this real life experience, we are personally committed to the mission of 'lifting' these most deserving children. Your referrals will be the most valuable endeavor. Our professional commitment to you is that we earnestly provide not only outstanding results to our buyers and sellers, but also benefit a deserving underprivileged child.
